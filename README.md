# AlgoSharp
This is a collection of algorithms made to be useable for future projects and a catalyst for me to improve my knowledge of data structures and algorithms as a whole.

### Self Imposed Rules of this Project

* I can not look up any solutions to the problem written in any form of code with the exclusion of pseudo code.
* I will only using overviews and high level explanations of how an algorithm works and avoid step by step run downs.
* I will aim to avoid using pseudo code as much as possible and only resort to using it if I am absolutely stuck on solving a problem.
* I will aim to understand the fundamentals of designing an algorithm and not using the algorithms themselves. The goal is understanding the process not the implementation.
