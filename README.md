# AlgoSharp
This is a collection of algorithms made to be useable for future projects and a catalyst for me to improve my knowledge of data structures and algorithms as a whole.

### Self Imposed Rules of this Project

* I can not look up any solutions to the problem written in any form of code with the exclusion of pseudo code.
* I will only be using overviews and high level explanations of how an algorithm works and avoid step by step run downs.
* I will aim to avoid using pseudo code as much as possible and only resort to using it if I am absolutely stuck on solving a problem.
* I will aim to understand the fundamentals of designing an algorithm and not using the algorithms themselves. The goal is understanding the process not the implementation.
* I will allow myself to read official documentation of specific language features, but will not allow reading any code that may give me the solution to the problem.
* I will allow myself to look up information on errors I may encounter so long as I will not gain any information on implementation of any algorithms or data structures.


### Goals of this Project

* Build a fundamental understanding of data structures and algorithms.
* Implement every common algorithm.
* Build a completely independent algorithm library for my own personal use.
